* **Did They Hurt Growth? A Synthetic Control Estimate of the Impact of “Bachelet’s Reforms”.** [[draft]](http://erciomunoz.github.io/files/Draft_21Jan2019.pdf) <details> <summary> abstract </summary> This paper uses the synthetic control method to estimate the short-term impact on GDP of the reforms implemented between 2014 and 2017 in Chile by the government of President Michelle Bachelet. I find a cumulative fall by the end of 2017 of 13% relative to the synthetic counterfactual. This result is robust to the use of a donor pool that includes economies for which primary commodities are relevant, as well as one that
only includes OECD countries. </details>
